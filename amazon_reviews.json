            "review": "- Switched completely to A2 bilona ghee for its amazing benefits. It is pricey, but the benefits are worth it.- Absolutely loved the quality, aroma and texture of this ghee- I have tried other bilona ghee in the past, but this feels really fesh and authentic- Very convenient and premium packing. Glass jar with tin lid is perfect to avoid spillage and convenient storage.Bonus advice - You can use the glass jar later for decorating flowers once you've devoured the ghee.Going to order many more bottles of Ghee from Village Company very soon! :)"

They promptly sent a duplicate order along with a generous gift of 300 grams of lemon blossom honey.To my delight, both the original and duplicate orders eventually arrived. The customer service at Village Company is exceptional, truly putting their customers first. As for the product itself, the quality of the ghee is top-notch. My mother, who grew up eating homemade ghee from own cows, said this ghee brought back memories of her childhood with its authentic taste and aroma.I am now a loyal customer for life and highly recommend Village Company for their outstanding products and unparalleled customer service. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!😊"

When my mom looked at the ghee, her first words were that it looks exactly like what they used to have in their teenage.Now everything in my home is cooked in this ghee and she has started making a lot of new sweets or items in the home itself.The ghee comes in a glass jar and packing from the seller is another plus point. The ghee is packed in a shock absorbing card board type material which prevents it from breakage. I literally dropped the box once but nothing happened to the ghee jar.Thank you village company for bringing this ghee to us."

It’s delicious and the aroma is heavenly. And it’s made from curd so I think it will be more nutritious than regular malai ghee. Almost half of the 500 ml jar is already finished and we are now ordering the 1000 ml jar. I never usually write product reviews but excellent products like these deserve praise so that these are always available to us. Amazing product by Village Company!!"

I’ve tried it with multiple dishes, both sweet and savoury and the results have been great - it adds richness to the flavour. The organic aspect is a big plus - pesticides and additive free ghee makes me feel good about what I'm putting in my body. Would highly recommend it for folks looking to balance health and tasty eating."
