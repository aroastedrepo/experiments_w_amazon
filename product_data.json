Awesome smell and texture. Then we ordered kangyam cow ghee, gir cow ghee and all ghee’s are superb. My mother told me that this ghee reminded her of the way it used to be in their young days - same smell, texture and taste. This was the best approval I got and till date have already placed an order of 7 litres of ghee.\nThere are a lot other ghee in the market but I think this is far more superior and affordable. Plus you have a all time support too where you get all your questions answered.\nThank you Village Company for ending my search for a genuine A2 ghee."
